# BFWeb

A Brainf*ck interpreter online. Visit [](https://zhangzheheng12345.github.io/BFWeb) to have a try.

### How to use

The Run button runs the Brainf*ck code in the large text area. The Show Data button shows or hides the data. The input widget after IO: enables you to type your inputs ( "," command in BF will get the input from here, but you should get the inputs ready before press the Run button), and see the outputs ( "." command in BF will output to here).

### Will support

A visual runner, which shows how the pointer moves and how the BF program changes data.
