# BFWeb

A Brainf\*ck interpreter online. Visit [BFWeb Github Page](https://zhangzheheng12345.github.io/BFWeb) to have a try.
If you don't have any idea about what Brainf\*ck exactly is, visit [Brainf\*ck wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck).

### How to use

The Run button runs the Brainf\*ck code in the large text area. The Show Data button shows or hides the data. The input widget after IO: enables you to type your inputs ( "," command in Brainf\*ck will get the input from here, but you should get the inputs ready before press the Run button), and see the outputs ( "." command in Brainf\*ck will output to here).

This interpreter also provides some features which the Brainf**k standard doesn't include. For example, '#' declares a note which continues to the end of the line. And the maximum number of a memory cell is not 255, but the maximum value of the ``` number ``` type in Javascript.

### Will support

A visual runner, which shows how the pointer moves and how the BF program changes data.
