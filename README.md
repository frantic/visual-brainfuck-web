# BFWeb

A Brainf*ck interpreter online. Visit [BFWeb Github Page](https://zhangzheheng12345.github.io/BFWeb) to have a try.
If you have any idea about what Brainf*ck exactly is, visit [esolangs.org, brainf*ck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck)

### How to use

The Run button runs the Brainf*ck code in the large text area. The Show Data button shows or hides the data. The input widget after IO: enables you to type your inputs ( "," command in Brainf*ck will get the input from here, but you should get the inputs ready before press the Run button), and see the outputs ( "." command in Brainf*ck will output to here).

### Will support

A visual runner, which shows how the pointer moves and how the BF program changes data.
